"Jennifer Schindler","Mixed","Pro","Neutral","Mixed","Neutral","Neutral","Neutral","Pro","* ""Housing was again identified as a top priority for the city, for fiscal year 2025, 2026.""\n* ""The Commission also serves as the recommending body to the City Council for major subdivisions, rezoning conditional development permits zoning ordinance amendments, general plan amendments, and environmental reviews associated with those projects. If applicable, the planning Commission reviews and makes recommendations on Bmr. Agreements.""\n* ""I very much appreciate Commissioner Peruzzy's questions about just wanting to understand the nature of what had sort of contributed to the cafe and the coworking space not working out... it's very much appreciated for the broader community, and certainly for this planning commission to understand what market dynamics are.""\n* ""I will definitely be supporting this project, without any conditions. I don't have any concerns about any of the six documents, either. They all support the points clearly enough.""\n* ""I move that the Planning Commission recommend approval of the project to the City Council, and highlight for Council's consideration the Commission's desire that… One, the applicant add additional retail to the project. Two, this project contribute to the completion of the Middle Avenue undercrossing. And three, the applicant will seek to build additional housing on top of the 800 units already committed.""\n* ""The project would provide much needed affordable housing, especially for teachers and noted the powerful public comments speaking to that. She said she was particularly heartened that they had not heard commentary that explicitly opposed the entire project, noting greater opposition earlier in the project’s development.""\n* ""From her perspective that under the state density bonus law the waivers and incentives were essentially nonnegotiable, and the waivers were unlimited. She said great points had been made to try to get creative with encouraging bicycle use specifically through parking and storage, access through Flood Park and potentially at some point access through the emergency access point onto van Buren by Haven Family House.""\n* ""For those reasons she was not supportive of any additional explicit requirements to the approval other than the text changes to the resolution that Planner Turner laid out in his presentation."""
"Andrew Ehrich","Neutral","Pro","Neutral","Pro","Neutral","Neutral","Neutral","Pro","* ""The need for housing in our community, I think, has been not only well documented in this process in this meeting, but is codified in the city's goals, and has been well spoken to. I was particularly... and the reality of where we sit as a planning commission is that we often have to decide... make decisions that can't satisfy all of these priorities. And I think for various reasons, I feel that it's incumbent upon me to support this project because of the house, because the need for housing is so incredibly acute and dire and important.""\n* ""I'm in favor of whatever additional bicycle parking could be added to the site as it was clear that would help with traffic mitigation. I encouraged as much pedestrian and bicycle access as possible to Van Buren.""\n* ""Good points were made about access, bicycle parking and traffic. He said the project held critical importance for the City and because of the legal risk in anything they did that would delay the project that he was loath to ask anything else of the developer but was interested in other Commissioners’ thoughts.""\n* ""I would like to make a motion that we approve this project as per the staff report and the modifications read into the record by Mr. Turner as part of the staff presentation, that Staff prepare summary minutes for this meeting, and that those minutes include a note that the planning Commission does not agree with the applicants. Classification of class one bicycle parking based on Calgreen's Calgreen's definition of those of what bicycle parking is.""\n* ""I move that the Planning Commission adopt a resolution recommending the City Council accept the 2024 general Plan Annual Progress Report, which includes the housing element and environmental justice element, with an important note that while Menlo Park should be proud of our status as one of the few jurisdictions in California to technically produce sufficient housing in 2024. That fact should not decrease the urgency... with which our City must keep attacking the challenge of housing production, because the details of our current trajectory are not enough to give us confidence that the City’s current approach will ultimately meet the state’s RHNA [Regional Housing Needs Allocation] requirements, much less the spirit stated in our City’s Housing Element."""
"Katie Behroozi","Neutral","Pro","Neutral","Pro","Pro","Neutral","Neutral","Neutral","* ""She said for that reason she wanted to talk about the bicycle amenities. She said she lived near and bicycled frequently in this area and knew the destinations people went to. She said it was important to have secure, weatherproof bicycle storage at ground level and accessible ideally for lots of residents. She said outdoor bicycle parking like that in the downtown area was not what people needed for their homes as it did not protect the bicycles during inclement weather nor keep them from being stolen.""\n* ""She said she did not think the project was under parked, noting the prohibition on overnight street parking. She suggested unbundling the parking from the units so those who did not have a car got a discount or perhaps the parking spaces could be rented. She said they might find then that fewer parking spaces were needed and those could be dedicated to more secure safe bicycle storage.""\n* ""She said she had advocated for a second exit too and in a very public way previously, but now she thought that having an inconvenient vehicle route through Suburban Park, the wait to make a left turn on Bay Road, then a complicated intersection at Ringwood Avenue, then the Willow Road intersection to get over to East Palo Alto or Belle Haven would lead her to choose to bicycle as it would take her10 minutes rather than 20 minutes to do.""\n* ""I just wanted to, in the interest of disclosure. I live within a thousand feet, but not within 500 feet of this property. And so I'm not planning to recuse myself. I'm not. I don't. I don't know the applicants, and I have no substantive input to add.""\n* ""I just wanted to say that I appreciate the staff support of the applicant""\n* ""She said she watched the Fire Board meeting where they discussed the second exit. She said she was encouraged to hear the Fire Chief say the site team had worked really well with them and although current fire code did not require a second emergency exit that the applicants had added it in response to feedback. She said also that it would not just be a viable route for emergency vehicles to get into the site but could be used as an evacuation route."""
"Linh Dan Do","Neutral","Pro","Neutral","Neutral","Neutral","Neutral","Pro","Neutral","* ""I just want to comment on the lovely and dynamic interaction between the courtyards and living spaces in the home.""\n* ""I am strongly urging the planning Commission to approve this housing project. We are in the midst of a housing crisis, with many renters and workers being priced out of our community, making it difficult for families and individuals to secure stable housing. This project to me represents an opportunity to address that need by adding over 100 new units, including affordable units for lower income residents which is crucial for maintaining a diverse and thriving community.""\n* ""Thank you. Chair. I support all my commissioners, fellow commissioners supportive comments off the top of my head. I don't have a response as to the flexibility of the parking, so I might come back to that I just want to make a comment. When you look at the Site plan, the design of a building, I feel like you can really tell. It maximizes fully the site.""\n* ""Thank you. Chair. I just want to say I really appreciated the presentation. the renderings, the perspective, the elevation, the presentation was different from what was shown in the Staff report, which is totally fine, but it was helpful to see the design that is envisioned.""\n* ""Supports efforts to keep massing lower for 519 Central Avenue to not be imposing on side yards."""
"Katie Ferrick","Neutral","Mixed","Neutral","Pro","Pro","Mixed","Neutral","Neutral","* ""I cannot make the CEQA determination... I hope they would consider continuing the project to further work on access points, vehicle transportation and nonvehicular transportation circulation... I looked forward to approving the project when they could be assured of a timeline for a second access point through the Caltrans right of way to Van Buren.""\n* ""I can't get to. Yes tonight, because no study or mitigation for most of the most impacted intersections of the project was done. I don't feel the Commission has been able to sufficiently do its job so that we can ensure the project is planned well, and future projects can be accommodated.""\n* ""The lack of willingness to reconsider using trades people from construction trades locally was surprising and disappointing.""\n* ""No project is perfect, and I'm not 100% comfortable with the project, I think. But hearing what I've heard tonight, I do appreciate the developer being very transparent. All the comments, all the community coming forward. And I think it's on us as a city to. We have a lot of planning documents and processes. We just need to be more, I think, targeted. And the things we're talking about with the developer ahead of time, such as park access, such as really focusing. Since we champion ourselves as a community that values climate change, you know, resiliency, etc, to plan for things like that ahead of time.""\n* ""I would encourage staff or encourage us in the future to look more at variances as as ways of granting relief and granting ways for development to occur in Menlo Park, and I would add that in this case we are prioritizing trees. But we could also prioritize things like speed of development or ease of development in the city, and I think those would be equally, if not more, important, priorities as well.""\n* ""I think the bigger the big answer in my view is both is that we need to do both, you know. Fill out the forms and count the numbers But I also would disagree with the sentiment that the adu policies. I think they've moved the needle a lot."""

He said he thought it should ideally be emphasized to incentive residents to either walk and take the bus, or bicycle to commute to work and to reduce traffic on local streets.""\n* ""He said in terms of parking that the site plan in general looked like a big concrete parking lot, which would encourage those who would live there to park their cars and drive. He said it was great to have the open space with the playground and green space and noted its proximity to Flood Park as well. He said he did not want to do anything that would cause a large redesign, but he thought that something to incentivize people to use alternate transportation should be the focus such as charging for parking. He said more sheltered bicycle storage on the first floor would be very good.""\n* ""I'm a little confused because there's the new zoning, but then there's also CDP that kind of modifies a lot of the zoning.""\n* ""I generally like this project. I think it's great that you've lived in the neighborhood for so long, and you want to accommodate your larger family. I think, as neighbors. That's what we would want is a homeowner improving their lot the way they see fit. And so, and I, from what I saw on the spec sheet. Everything is within our zoning requirements, so I'm happy to support this project, but want to hear what other commissioners have to say."""
"Ross Silverstein","Mixed","Pro","Neutral","Pro","Pro","Neutral","Neutral","Neutral","* ""I, too, cannot speak for the planning commission as a whole, but want to echo what you so well put in terms of the judgment calls that we are being asked to make for every permit that we give. In fact, most the majority of items that come before the planning Commission are a function of either specific lots or developments that are not in compliance. Otherwise they wouldn't be before the planning commission in the 1st place, and to whatever extent we can allow ourselves to make those calls and facilitate the speedy development or I guess the expediency of any given development. I think that would be fantastic. So consider myself to join in that crusade.""\n* ""He said he strongly supported the housing the project would provide, and while he wanted it to move forward, he was concerned about the lack of any real bicycle parking... He said the project proposed 88 long term bicycle parking spaces but he did not think the proposal would actually provide any. He said Calgreen’s specific building standards for bicycle parking stated that it must be at street level, not up three flights of stairs, not through an apartment, and not locked away on a balcony.""\n* ""He said although he was very supportive of the project, he wanted to insist on including a formal contingency to provide long term bicycle storage for future residents. He noted that the developer indicated they would be reactive to the needs of the community, but he thought that was insufficient as once vehicle spaces were there and used it would be harder to remove them and install bicycle storage then rather than at the same time the project was constructed.""\n* ""I guess to follow up on my original question around the intent of our housing policy is because, as a planning commission, we are asked to advise and approve projects, and a lot of the focus is on these specific numbers, and I fear that if over 10 years we demolished and rebuilt 2,000 single family homes, and then we added another 900 adus, and we were fully fully in compliance. I fear that we, as a community, would take our foot off the gas, so to speak, around actually adding new housing.""\n* ""He said he wanted to express broader disappointment over the evolution of the questions around bicycle parking as he thought two of their three official priorities were around their climate action plan and zero emission plan so how they promoted active transportation, how they reduced car dependency and so many of the little decisions they made along the way allowed then to move in that direction. He said he did not see that supported with this project."""
